## in this part we exucite or build with the help of parcel (npx parcel index.html) whem it build it create a server and run on the localhost port 1234

## install the react or react-dom dependency with the help of (npm install react react-dom) // this is better approch in the place of cdn

# we delete the cdn link fron the index file after intall react with npm

#### then import

#### import React from "react"

#### import ReactDOM from "react-dom"

#### to the app.js file

### this make error beacause in index.html we add script as normal javascript we make it type module

### add browserlist in package josn (using browserlist.dev site to check)
